# COMS4156-Project
Repository for COMS 4156 24F, Team Scrum Masters 

EventEase is a flexible RESTful service designed to simplify and automate the complexities of event management. EventEase offers a seamless solution to manage everything from event creation to event registration. With endpoints for task management, RSVP handling, and real-time reporting, EventEase empowers various applications with robust event management capabilities, allowing organizers and hosters to focus on delivering great user experiences. EventEase API makes it easy to integrate sophisticated event planning tools into any system, no matter the size or scope of your event.

To distinguish from regular event-management services and make it useful for elderly users, Eventease provides SMS and email reminders for events, allowing elderly users to stay informed without relying on complex apps. Additionally, a simple RSVP system could be integrated, enabling one-click RSVP via email or SMS, reducing the need for navigating complicated interfaces. The API would also support caregiver collaboration, allowing caregivers to manage event details, send RSVPs, or receive notifications on behalf of elderly users. Lastly, an option for simplified, large-text invitations or event details could be offered to ensure better accessibility for users with vision impairments or low digital literacy.
